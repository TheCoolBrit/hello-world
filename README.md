I am excited about space travel ever since as a child I watched the missions leading up to the Applo Moon landings, I rember staying up watching a tiny Black and White TV as Neil Armstrong said "Tranquility Base, The Eagle has landed" and "One small step for Man and one Giant leap for mankind"
I now follow all new space developments with great intrest and write up my thoughts on exosnews

My son Nathael is a keen programmer
